An Aston Martin DB10 from the James Bond film Spectre has sold for £2.4m at auction.

Ten items of 007 memorabilia from the 24th film in the franchise fetched just shy of £2.8m, with proceeds benefiting charities such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

Other lots included the Day of the Dead costume worn by Daniel Craig (£98,500) and villain Oberhauser's Spectre nine-carat solid gold ring worn by Christoph Waltz (32,500).

Comic David Walliams helped host the auction at Christie's, which attracted bidders from four continents.

The top item, the silver Aston Martin DB10, was bought for £2,434,500\.

An **[online-only auction][0]**with 14 other lots remains open until 23 February.
